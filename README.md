# Inventory_System_3d
The inventory system in which every inventory item is a 3d object having physics and rigid-body on it.
Currently, the used 3d assets are default unity built-in assets.
3d cube is represented as backpack which acts as a container to hold inventory data. 
3d spheres are inventory items.
You can drag & drop inventory items over the backpack to add items to the inventory.
To retrieve items from the backpack, you need to hover the mouse over the backpack and then press and hold the left mouse button. It will trigger and display the 2d UI in which the text name of inventory item will be displayed. You need to release the mouse up over the inventory item name which you want to retrive from the backpack.
